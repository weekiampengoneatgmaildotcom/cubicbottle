new way of organising development process of cubicbottle's ideas
so that 
1. tracking of lyrical changes is possible and
2. tracking of melody and structure changes can be possible
3. different versions of end products can be tracked (hopefully in the coming months) 

it used to be just dump everything to a server and creating a MANIFEST file
luckily dates were preserved

anyway. long story short
usually the development process is

1. start by a recording or a few recordings
2. they get crystallised to an idea
